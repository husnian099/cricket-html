            As Cricket has various formats, it has a different fan base for each of them.
            Some people like watching test matches because of their intensity and authenticity.
            While some enjoy Twenty-20, that require minimum engagement and are highly entertaining. 
            Test Match is a format of cricket that is quite traditional.
            
            It lasts up to five days and two countries play against each other in this match.
            Next up, we have the National League Systems, also called counties in England. Their
            duration is for three to four days.
            
            Limited Overs Cricket is another type where the number of episodes decides the format and 
            length of the game. Both the teams get to play a single inning and thus results are determined.
            
            However, if it rains, they apply the Duck worth- Lewis Method to attain results. One of
            the most common formats is One Day International also known as ODI. Two countries play
            against each other for a total of fifty overs. Finally, this is probably the most entertaining 
            format of cricket, the Twenty-20. It only has 20 overs to play and is quite exciting and engaging.
